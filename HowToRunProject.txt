HOW TO RUN THE ENTERPRISE AUTHENTICATION LOGIN SYSTEM

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
------------------

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will launch the application at http://localhost:3000

ALTERNATIVE VITE SETUP:
----------------------
If you encounter issues with the Create React App setup, you can try using Vite instead:

1. Update package.json scripts section:
   ```
   "scripts": {
     "dev": "vite",
     "build": "vite build",
     "preview": "vite preview"
   }
   ```

2. Run the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
- If you see only a blank page, check the browser console for errors
- Make sure you have all required dependencies installed
- Try clearing your browser cache
- If ReactDOM errors appear, make sure you're using the correct version of React

NOTE: This is a client-side only authentication system. All data is stored in your browser's localStorage and will be cleared if you clear your browser data.
